# Shibby-DAO

Shibby uses the DAO Module of gnosis: https://github.com/gnosis/dao-module

- Gnosis Safe: https://gnosis-safe.binance.org/#/safes/0x470b69f05D2C70736337F839944CD6B2692450c5/
- DAO contract: https://bscscan.com/address/0xDDC4BcC222F5D81F1b5d76737457d73402561A1c

- SHIBBY holders will be able to create proposals on https://snapshot.org/#/shibby.eth/
- SHIBBY holders will vote on the proposal
- If the proposal reaches >50% yes votes, the DAO will automatically send the proposed amount of funds to the proposed address.
- We will release a tutorial shortly how to setup a proposal
